Fixed most of the javascript, but got stuck on the footer.  It displays correctly and calculates the correct totals on the initial page load, but I can't figure out how to make it continually render at the bottom.  As such, new data entered via the form appears at the bottom, and does not update the totals in the footer.  I'm moving on the the CSS for both pages and content for the public-facing page until I can ask somebody about the JS.



changed addShit() to addTotals.
