I keep forgetting to update the readme.
And to learn markdown.

Also I made all of today's edits on master.  Woops.

Anyway, the JS and HTML are now working, so I'm committing changes to remote:master and I'll continue styling the CSS later.  Hopefully on its own branch.

(12 seconds later) I can't link to the most recent pull request to resubmit this assignment because i made all changes to master, so I checked out a new branch, made these edits, and tried again.  Hopefully this is the end of the file.

(15 minutes later) I forgot to add the daily total counter back into my table :(

2/15/2018 - was getting error in JS console @ line 68 but the table was still populating with valid data, turned out to be a problem with my for loops, changed storeHours.length to patStores.length and it fixed it, I was looping through the wrong array.  I will be pushing this change later along with the rest of today's work.
