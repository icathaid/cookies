discovered that if you enter a new store on the sales page and then generate an error (empty field, etc.) it will delete all of the previously user-generated data.  I'm pretty sure I can fix this by moving around the innerHTML = '' command or by adding a function call to where I create the new stores.

I tried to add a Home button to each page, but trying to figure out the buttons, event listeners, and linking to an html page from inside a js function became too time consuming so I'm back-burnering it for now.

When you collapse your browser window or zoom in, the nav links overflow out of the nav bar down onto the rest of the page but I'm not sure how to fix this.

still need to style the sales page and change the title and add home link

append margins to shorthand

forgot to add clear form fields on submit
