<p>Pat's Salmon Cookies was formed back in 2012, after a veryfortunate kitchen mishap late one night before a bake sale.  Pat's wife Pat was baking cookies for their son Pat's bake sale, and Pat spilled some of his famous salmon pate into the batter.  Nobody noticed the mistake until the next PTA meeting, when everybody kept asking the Pats for more of their delicious salmon cookies.  Recognizing the potential demand for something so uniquely Seattle, the two set out to deliver to the masses.  They began selling cookies from a cart just outside Pike Place, before eventually moving into a storefront inside the market.  Today we have five locations, with more on the way!</p>
